# Rain-predection-using-ML
We are going to use the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using various evaluation metrics.

We will use these algorithms:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  Decision Trees
3.  Logistic Regression
4.  SVM

We will evaluate our models using:

1.  Accuracy Score
2.  Jaccard Index
3.  F1-Score
4.  LogLoss
5.  Mean Absolute Error
6.  Mean Squared Error
7.  R2-Score

Finally, we will use models to generate the report displaying the accuracy scores.
